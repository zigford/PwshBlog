GNU Linux

I've always used GNU/Linux distributions on my machines at home sing 1997.
A brief list of the distributions I've used:

* Slackware
* RedHat
* CentOS
* Fedora Core
* Ubuntu
* Fedora
* Raspbian
* Gentoo

Currently, I'm using Gentoo on a few different machines and as an operating
system nerd, it really ticks the boxes.

Many people who have used Gentoo in the past eventually say that maintaining a
Gentoo system is fun at first, but that they have different priorities and want
an 'OS' that just 'works'.

Knowing everything about a system is part of the joy of Gentoo. Think of it not
as a distributioin, but more as a distribution kit. You get to make your own
distro.

Aside from that, I'm always running Raspbian and love what the little pie can
do.

Here are the things I can do in Gentoo:

* Connect to my work vpn
* RDP to work machines
* Use packaged Citrix Receiever to connect to our Citrix environment
* Use Snaps, to run the latest userland software
* Contribute in the form of ebuilds
