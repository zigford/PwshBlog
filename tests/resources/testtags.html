<p>Xargs tips</p>

<p>After 12 years being a Windows admin, I've now used powershell more than other
languages so I'm pretty fluent in it's syntax. So it makes me happy when I
stumble upon bash/linux scripting paradigms which have been brought over to
powershell.</p>

<hr />

<p>It's great to see the inspiration powershell has gained from
Unix systems and also great that it makes it easier for me to remember.</p>

<p>One paradigm I that I wished bash/*nix had is the <code>Foreach-Object</code> command.
It makes working on collections of objects a breeze. I often find myself
scratching my head when trying similar tasks on *nix. Enter <code>xargs</code></p>

<p>Take this simple situation: I have a directory and I want to delete everything
bar a single .config file.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a
.   blog.css  .entry-23032.md      .footer.html  main.css
..  .config   .entry-23032.md.swp  .header.html  .title.html
</code></pre>

<p>My powershell brain wants to:</p>

<pre><code>$ gci | ? Name -ne '.config' | foreach-object { ri $_ }
</code></pre>

<p>On *nix, Xargs is a bit like adding pipeline input to rm</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a | grep -v '\.config' | xargs rm $_
</code></pre>

<p>The beauty of this is that the default item variable for xargs is <code>$_</code> which is exactly
what powershell uses in a foreach-object loop.</p>

<p>Of coarse the powershell line could be a bit shorter</p>

<pre><code>$ gci | ? Name -ne '\.config' | ri
</code></pre>
