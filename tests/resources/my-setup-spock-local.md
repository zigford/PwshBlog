My setup

Physical
--------

**Office**

My home office is 1 of the bays of our [bestsheds](www.bestsheds.com.au)
American barn style shed. The office bay has a sliding stacker door entrance,
long window and is seperated from the other bays by a mixture of bookshelves,
office partitions and curtains.

**Desk**

My computer desk is part of a frame used to carry car tyres on a pickup truck
with a large mdf sheet on top. Thus it's quite tall, so I have a platform to
stand on made out of some sawn off pailings nailed to some 4x4's.

**Chair**

The current chair is absolute garbage, so I spend most of my time standing with
the occaisional sit down to rest the feet. I do intend to upgrade my chair when
I can find the funding and the right chair with the required height.

Technology
----------

**PC**

My main PC is a workstation I built in 2013, so it has a haswell i5-4670, a 
256Gb SSD, a 2TB mirrored data disk and an AMD Radeon HD6950.
The screen is an LG 27" 1080p display. Keyboard an IBM Model M and a stock 
standard logitech mouse.

**Laptops**

Although I don't own any laptops, my work requires I'm using different laptops
in various states on configuration. I regularly use the following

* Dell Precision 5510 (32G ram, 500G SSD, 750G HDD)
* ~~Late 2014 15" Macbook Pro (500G SSD, 16G ram)~~
* Surface Pro 3
* 13" 2017 Macbook Pro (256G SSD, 8G ram)

**Other machines**

As I have 6 kids I also have a machine for each of them for when we have game
night.

* Dell Precision M4800
* Lenovo ThinkCenter x2
* Dell OptiPlex GX620
* Home built AMD FX-4300 based PC
* Raspberry PI as a desktop in the house for homework
* HP xw8400 Workstation
