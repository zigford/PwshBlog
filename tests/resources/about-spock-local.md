About

"Hi, my name is Jesse Harris. I'm a self professed operating systems nerd.
I actively use current versions of [Windows](windows.html), 
[GNU/Linux](gnu-linux.html), [Macos](macos.html) and dabble in
[the BSDs](the-bsds.html).

I work for a [University](https://usc.edu.au) in the client systems area, where
I do a fair amount of scripting.

* [My setup](my-setup.html)

I want to use this site to share my insites about the differences in the
operating systems in an unbiased way."
