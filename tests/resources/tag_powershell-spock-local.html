<p>Powershell <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases">6.1.0</a> dropped yesterday. Here is my quick look.</p>

<h2>New Commands</h2>

<p><code>Get-Command | Measure-Object</code> on each version:</p>

<p>Version 6.0.4 had 316 commands, while 6.1.0 has 323 commands. Comparing a list
of commands:</p>

<p>On 6.0.4: <code>gcm | select -exp name &gt; 6.0.4.txt</code> and the same on 6.1.0, then to
compare:</p>

<pre><code>    compare-object (gc ./6.0.4.txt) (gc ./6.1.0.txt)

    InputObject             SideIndicator
    -----------             -------------

    Get-ExperimentalFeature =&gt;

<p>Most people have long forgotten the lowly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">hosts</a> file, but from time to
time there is still a need to use it.</p>

<p>So I wrote some powershell functions to automate it in a simpler way.</p>

<p>June Blender writing for <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2015/07/04/weekend-scripter-welcome-to-the-powershell-information-stream/">Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dilemma was how to fix the harmful aspects of Write-Host (can't suppress,
capture, or redirect), but keep it from polluting the output stream. And of
course, the solution must be backward compatible.</p>

<p>This most elegant solution is provided by the information stream and the
Write-Information cmdlet. The information stream is a new output stream that
works much like the error and warning streams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The information stream is a feature of powershell versions 5.x that I missed
when it came out. Thus I have been avoiding using Write-Host in favour of
Write-Verbose since reading about <a href="http://www.jsnover.com/blog/2013/12/07/write-host-considered-harmful/">Write-Host Considered Harmful</a>.</p>

<p>If you care about writing reusable automation friendly code, go have a read.</p>

Replacing bash scripting with powershell
</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ninjaaron/replacing-bash-scripting-with-python">This</a> article on replacing bash scripting with python was being shared
around on twitter today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is if you want to do basically anything else, e.g. write logic, 
use control structures, handle complex data... You're going to have big 
problems. When Bash is coordinating external programs, it's fantastic. When 
it's doing any work whatsoever itself, it disintegrates into a pile of 
garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, this is what is awesome about PowerShell. I feel like it gets the shell
part right, and also supports sane logic, data structures and so on. Sticking
to the same language for quick system admin tasks and for longer form script
writing really helps learn the ins-and-outs of a language.</p>

<p>As for python, I have started writing some of my regular tools for use on
linux in python and so far it just doesn't seem as natural as powershell,
although that could just be because powershell is like muscle memory for me.</p>

<p>I'd love to give powershell a better chance on linux, but, it is a bit slow
to spin up on the <a href="raspberry-pi.html">raspberry pi</a> and not available
everywhere. For instance to use it on Gentoo, I've got it installed as a snap.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or feedback, please <a href="mailto:jesse@zigford.org">email</a>
me and let me know if you will allow your feedback to be posted here.</p>

<p><a href="tag_xargs.html">xargs</a> strikes again. This time I'm going to use it's parallel

<p>After 12 years being a Windows admin, I've now used powershell more than other
languages so I'm pretty fluent in it's syntax. So it makes me happy when I
stumble upon bash/linux scripting paradigms which have been brought over to
powershell.</p>

<h4>Update 20/09/2018</h4>
<p>Updated the script to UseBasicParsing so it works on Server core out of the box.
Also, if you have to allow the port on Windows Firewall:</p>
<p><code>New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow SSH" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 22 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow</code></p>
<h4>Update 11/09/2018</h4>
<p>I've made a copy of this <a href="scripts.html">script</a> which downloads the dependencies (including
PSCore. Also of note, on a machine I ran it on, I had to set the allowed .Net
TLS modes before it would let me download from github.</p>
<p><code>[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "tls12, tls11, tls"</code> </p>
