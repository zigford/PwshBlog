<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Many will think it is heresy to put binary packages on a Gentoo system 
let alone a package system which encourages binary packages to come with
their own set of shared libraries. </p>

<p>While I tend to agree, the practicality of sticking to this arrangement 
can be difficult for a couple of cases. Here are a few I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source not available</li>
<li>No binary package or source ebuild for Gentoo</li>
<li>ebuild takes too long to compile</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of ebuilds taking too long (eg. chromium), I have a limited
budget and can't really afford to leave my power hungry desktop on 24/7
to keep chromium builds up-to-date.</p>

<p>Here are a quick list of software that I use which fall into one of these 
categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Citrix Reciever</li>
<li>Powershell (Available as source, but no ebuild and I haven't had the 
time to try write one myself)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Gaming with the kids)</li>
<li>Discord (Chatting with games)</li>
<li>Chromium (Primarily a firefox user, but have some trouble with getting it 
to see and work with Citrix)</li>
</ul>

<p>With my excuses for putting snap's on Gentoo out of the way, here is how 
I've got it working for my systems.</p>

<h2>Overlay</h2>

<p>There are a few overlay's for Gentoo out there. Even an official one 
maintained (or as the case may be, unmaintained) by 
<a href="https://github.com/zyga">zyga</a> from Canonical. I tried that one, and many 
of the forks with no such luck.</p>

<p>After googling around I stumbled on a thread on 
<a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/gentoo-update-needed/3029/15">snapcraft.io</a> 
and a post from user jamesb192 about the progress on their snapd overlay. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JamesB192/JamesB192-overlay">JamesB192 overlay</a> works,
but it doesn't have an overlay.xml file for adding with layman. 
To overcome this, I've hosted one on my site 
<a href="http://jesseharrisit.com/overlay.xml">here</a>. You can add this to your 
system using overlay like this:</p>

<pre><code>        echo app-portage/layman git &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.use/layman
        emerge app-portage/layman
        layman -o http://jesseharrisit.com/overlay.xml -f -a JamesB192
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have the overlay installed should be able to emerge snapd 
like so:</p>

<pre><code>        emerge app-emulation/snapd
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note - You may need to adjust your kernel config and the ebuild is 
pretty good at highlighting which options need to be set.</em></p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>During my testing of snaps on Gentoo, I've come across a couple of issues 
that either have been solved or could be solved in the ebuild</p>

<ol>
<li>snap packages only install and run as root (This was solved by setting 
suid on /usr/lib64/snapd/snap-confine, and solved in ebuild 2.34)</li>
<li>/var/lib/snapd not created (manually mkdir the directory)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final thoughts.</h2>

<p>Snap packages feel like a great augmentation for Gentoo. It allows me to 
keep using Gentoo as a daily driver and augment some of it's missing 
packages with packages from more popular distros.</p>
