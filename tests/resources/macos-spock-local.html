<p>in 2006 I bought my first Mac. A white Macbook, the second generation of Intel
with a core 2 duo processor. Even though it had a spinning disk when you clicked
on safari it would launch instantly. It was amazingly fast.</p>

<p>Back then the OS was 10.4 Tiger. Tiger was the pinnicle of Apple operating
systems. It was the first time an OS X operating system had all the features
one would need, and before they started adding cruft to slow the system down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Extremely fast boot</li>
<li>Spotlight search (Still better than Windows search to this day)</li>
<li>Better trackpad feel</li>
<li>Unix and X11 support</li>
<li>Automator</li>
<li>Slick responsive and cohesive ui</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have parallels desktop on my macbook, and I recall collegues being
amazed to see me running Mac OS, Ubuntu and Windows concurrently without
any apparent performance hit. I feel like I've not had a computer as good as 
that macbook since.</p>

<p>Sadly over time the macbook developed a problem with the backlight and with the
battery failing it became unusable. Work had started providing me with their
laptops, so it didn't seem to make sense to buy a macbook again.</p>

<p>On the upside, tomrrow (07/09/2018), I will be getting a work supplied macbook. 
 :)</p>

<p>I'll update this article with my experiences.</p>
