<h3>Updated 17/08/2018</h3>

<p>Coding can be fun. I've enjoyed coding from a young age, starting with
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-Basic</a> at maybe 6, 7, or 8.</p>

<p>I remember my brother Alex seemed like a real genius with the computer (an IBM
clone made by Acer 8086 XT). Using Basic he could make the computer do anything
and was writing his own games.</p>

<p>Back then, how we edited code would make us laugh today and I would say we take
the humble text editor for granted. Even something like notepad.exe is amazing
compared to tools of yesteryear. Here is a sample to illustrate: 
To see your code you would have to type <code>LIST&lt;ENTER&gt;</code>:   </p>

<pre><code>    &gt;LIST

    10 PRINT "WELCOME TO JESSES GAME"
    20 PRINT "ENTER YOUR NAME"
    30 $I = INPUT
    40 PRINT "WELCOME $I, STRAP YOURSELF IN"
</code></pre>

<p>To edit a line of code you would re-write it by typing it in, line number and 
all.</p>

<pre><code>    20 PRINT "ENTER YOUR FULL NAME"
</code></pre>

<p>And to insert a line, start a line with a number between existing lines</p>

<pre><code>    31 $A=$I
</code></pre>

<p>When you ran out of in-between-lines there was a command you could run to
reindex your lines which would space them all out 10 between each other.</p>

<p>Since then, the notepad, notepad++, programmers notepad, vim, nano, gedit, 
bbedit and countless other advanced (or not-so-advanced) text editors have
evolved.</p>

<p>vi was born out of ed a streaming text editor which didn't really have a user
interface so it was kind of more like how I edited my BASIC programs. One thing 
it did have were commands. Example of vim commands:</p>

<p>You've just run your script/app and get a syntax error on line 432. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> PS&gt; .\bigscript.ps1
 At C:\bigscript.ps1:432 char:27
 + if ($true) {echo "True" | {echo true}}
 +                           ~~~~~~~~~~~
 Expressions are only allowed as the first element of a pipeline.
 + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParseException
 + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ExpressionsMustBeFirstInPipeline
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So you crack open bigscript in vim (btw, vim is amazing at handling big files)
Enter, <code>432Gf|a?&lt;ESC&gt;:wq</code> done.</p>

<p>To break that down, <code>432G</code> will put the cursor at line 432, <code>f|</code> will move the 
cursor <em>forward</em> to the <code>|</code>, <code>a?</code> will <em>append</em> a <code>?</code>, then \<ESC> will return
vim back to normal mode and <code>:wq</code> puts vim in command mode and execute <em>w</em>rite
<em>q</em>uit. </p>

<p>Now that might seem a bit obtuse if your not a vim user, but to me that is
muscle memory and if coding is your life, this is something you are going to
want to learn.</p>

<p>If this interests you, and you start your vim journey, then read on. I will
share my vim configuration and history of using vim.</p>

<h2>My vim story</h2>

<p>When my Dad was about the same age as I am now (35), he went back to 
University to study Computer Science. I remember him bringing home Slackware 
and RedHat on floppies, which we would install and he would give me lessons on 
using Vi possibly vim, but I didn't know at the time.  (This is probably around
1996).</p>

<p>Since finishing School and entering the workforce I have mostly worked in
Windows environments. Even still, with the occasionaly need to touch GNU/Linux
at work and often testing Distro's at home I would always feel more efficient
when using Vi/m.</p>

<p>My feeling when using another editor is that moving around and changing text
feels so lethargic when done one button at a time. This drove me in recent
years to keep a copy of vim in my home profile.</p>

<p>Around 2011 I switched from VBScript and the occasional perl script to writing
fulltime in Powershell, so it made sense to try a few different editors which
are more native to the Windows platform. I tried Visual Studio Code, Powershell
ISE, Notepad++ and still kept coming back to vim.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code is a great alternative, and it's Powershell extensions are
very good. If you do choose to use it, install the vim extension too. It brings 
the vim commands to vscode.
Hoever being an electron app, it suffers from performance and memory
consumption issues. I love squeezing every drop of battery out of my PC and
when you see 7mb RAM on Vim vs 500Mb+ on VSCode, you might rethink your
choices.</p>

<p>Therefore I've resorted to delving into the world of customizing vim and 
setting up plugins.</p>

<p>One of the main things I'm trying to acheive is a cross platform configuration.
You see, at work I'm on Windows and MacOs and at home I'm on Gentoo Linux. So I
have written my .vimrc file to work on any platform. I usually sync it with 
OneDrive for Business and symlink it into my linux/mac/Windows home directory 
with a seperate setup script.  Without further ado, here it is with some
comments</p>

<h2>.vimrc</h2>
