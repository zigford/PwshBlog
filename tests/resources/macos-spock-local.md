macOS

in 2006 I bought my first Mac. A white Macbook, the second generation of Intel
with a core 2 duo processor. Even though it had a spinning disk when you clicked
on safari it would launch instantly. It was amazingly fast.

Back then the OS was 10.4 Tiger. Tiger was the pinnicle of Apple operating
systems. It was the first time an OS X operating system had all the features
one would need, and before they started adding cruft to slow the system down.

* Extremely fast boot
* Spotlight search (Still better than Windows search to this day)
* Better trackpad feel
* Unix and X11 support
* Automator
* Slick responsive and cohesive ui

I also have parallels desktop on my macbook, and I recall collegues being
amazed to see me running Mac OS, Ubuntu and Windows concurrently without
any apparent performance hit. I feel like I've not had a computer as good as 
that macbook since.

Sadly over time the macbook developed a problem with the backlight and with the
battery failing it became unusable. Work had started providing me with their
laptops, so it didn't seem to make sense to buy a macbook again.

On the upside, tomrrow (07/09/2018), I will be getting a work supplied macbook.

I'll update this article with my experiences.
