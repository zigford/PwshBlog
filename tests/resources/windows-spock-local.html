<h4>My opinions of Windows</h4>

<p>Many in the free software community regard Windows as a pile of garbage. While
it does have it's flaws, I think many of these conclusions fail to see the 
case for Windows.</p>

<p>I've read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1416925.Show_Stopper_">book</a> 'Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows 
NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft', and there are a few other <a href="https://medium.com/@benbob/what-really-happened-with-vista-an-insiders-retrospective-f713ee77c239">posts</a>
around the internet about the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-really-happened-with-vista-4ca7ffb5a1a">troubled</a> history of Windows development.</p>

<p>Even with all of the beuracracy that has burdened it's development, it feels
like MS have really turned a corner with Windows 10.</p>

<h4>The good</h4>

<p>Here are some of the less commonly appreciated aspects of Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Runs on extrodinarily varied hardware</li>
<li>NTFS Volume Shadow Copies (Like free snapshots in btrfs and zfs)</li>
<li>Can take on any number of personalities (like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">WSL</a> and 32bit windows on 64bit)</li>
<li>Can boot from a filesystem in a file (vhd)</li>
<li>Deeply scriptable (I've seen many say Windows is GUI only. Fallacy)</li>
<li>Out-of-band data deduplication. (Amazing feature that I haven't seen
replicated as well on Linux)</li>
<li>Highly customizable for business use cases</li>
<li>Strong sleep / power saving support</li>
<li>Robust remote desktop solution (No other OS has this implemented as well)</li>
<li>Great built-in virutalization</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a></li>
<li>Ability to refresh the PC with the click of a button</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also writing this article from a Windows command prompt on a Microsoft
Surface Pro 3. By the way, did you know openssh comes built-in to Windows since
the April 2018 release?</p>

<h4>The bad</h4>

<p>Some of these items are not the fault of Windows directly, but indirectly due
to being the most popular desktop operating system. In these cases a diligent
systems administrator can overcome these negative aspects of running Windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horrible console (Improvements coming with <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/08/02/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/">ConPTY</a>)</li>
<li>No developer culture - Many developers have created user hostile apps 
(ie, apps that consume too many resources, start on boot, are kinda like 
malware)</li>
<li>The need to run Anti-Virus software. (Seriously annoying as often the AV
software consumes as many resources as the apps you are running, effectivly
halving the performance of your PC)</li>
<li>Third-party application install experience. (This problem is slowly going away as
more Win32 apps enter the store via <a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/what-is-project-centennial">Project Centenial</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also of note is that now that Microsoft is starting to push <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq">S mode</a>, some
of these issues may go away. Running a PC lean on third-party apps really makes
it a dream to use. Super long battery life, quiet, cool, bug-free. If you can
live with the built-in apps, I highly recommend giving it a go.</p>

<h4>My history with Windows</h4>

<p>My usage of windows has it's origins in MS-DOS, as it would for many who used
computers in the late 80's or earlie 90's. </p>

<p>Having used PC's since then, I've always had, either through work or home a PC
running a version of Windows covering most of the major releases.</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 3.11 (at home on the parents PC)</li>
<li>Windows 95 (on my own PC, also began running Linux around this time)</li>
<li>Windows 98 (again on my own PC)</li>
<li>Windows 2000 Server (home PC)</li>
<li>Windows XP (Home and Work)</li>
<li>Windows 7 (Home and Work)</li>
<li>Windows 8.1 (Work, testing Surface hardware)</li>
<li>Windows 10 (Work)</li>
</ul>

<p>A keen windows user may notice I skipped Milenium edition, Vista, and Windows 
8. I did use them, but never ran them for any significant amount of time. I also
haven't listed any of the Server editions that I regularly used at work.
This list is just those used as a desktop operating system.</p>

<p>Since Windows XP, I've also been responsible for developing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Operating_Environment">MOE</a>, and
repackaging software for use at work.</p>
